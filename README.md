A full stack web application that allows the user to create and track programming projects between themselves and their teammates

Optimizations:

Was able to get a bit meta with this one. It was nice to work with and use the principles of agile software while designing an app to help other keep their software development agile

for this one the paradigm takes the structure of

Create: Allows the user to initialize a project with a progression level, team lead, team members, and a deadline. All of this information is stored in the database as a document

Read: Once a project is tracked it appears in a tabular format for ease of tracking, upon being marked as complete, completed project show up in their own section

Update: Once in the tracking table the user is allow to alter the progression level of the project via a drop down. This progress level is updated accordingly within the data base

Delete: The user has the option to delete projects from their tracking table once generated.
